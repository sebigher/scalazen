//declaring values and variables

val answer = 8 - 2
answer + 1

// a value declared by val is a constant

//variables: the content can vary
var x: Int = 4
x = 3

// the type is inferred from the type
// of the expression used when initialize

//you cannot declare a variable without initializing it
//only traits and abstract classes can have declared but undefined members
//var yyy: Int

//Strings
var yyy = "3" + 5
yyy = 5 + "3"
